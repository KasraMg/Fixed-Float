                                    As soon as your transaction arrives at our address and receives the required number of network confirmations, the exchange is automatically performed and a transaction is sent to your address.

                                    If you send us a transaction with a low network fee, you risk spending a lot of time waiting for the order to be completed. The order will be executed automatically only after your transaction receives the required number of network confirmations. Due to the low fees, the transaction may have poor priority and not be confirmed by the network anytime soon.

                                    The average amount of the network fee is individual for each blockchain, and depending on the current load, it may change. The more you set the <a href="">network fee</a>, the higher the priority of the transaction and the faster it will be processed. Usually, the optimal network fee is automatically calculated by your wallet.

                                    If you have sent us a transaction on the Bitcoin or Ethereum network and are waiting for a network confirmation for a long time, you can increase the priority of your transaction on the network using the RBF feature.

                                    The speed of transaction processing depends on the bandwidth of the blockchain and the set fee of the network when it is sent.

                                    If your transaction has not arrived before the order time has passed, on the order page you will be able to choose:

                                    Continue the exchange at a floating rate. The order will be executed after the transaction is received and the required number of network confirmations is received.
                                    <br />
                                    Make a refund of the amount sent for the exchange minus the network fee. To do this, you need to specify your address, to which the coins will be returned after receiving your transaction.
